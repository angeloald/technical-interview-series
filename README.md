# Technical Interview Series

This is my technical interview practice series that I gave to college students and a few technology professionals in a Discord server during the summer of 2020. I'm writing down what we did in this e-book because other people were not able to attend the workshops due to external factors like school, work, and COVID-19-related issues.

I will be terse because people hate reading. I hope reading this book helps you find employment and leads. There will be 10 chapters dealing with techniques you can use in technical interviews. Most questions are sourced from Leetcode, but some come from other sites.
