## Foreword

This is the text form of my technical interview workshop series that I gave to students and industry professionals in a Discord server during the summer of 2020. I'm writing down what we did because others could not attend the workshops due to school, work, and COVID-19. 

I will start by reviewing concepts from a generic data structures and algorithms course then discuss specific patterns you need to know for most technical interviews.
